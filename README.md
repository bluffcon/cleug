# Cleug â€” Mines, Tools, Villagers, & more!
ðŸ’« **__Cleug__ is a simple, non-modular RPG & Mines Datapack** for Minecraft worlds. Potential use cases are: Prison servers, servers with auto-generating resource mines, map builders for said servers who need a simple and plug-n-play Datapack, and every every other potential use case!

## Customization
Cleug isn't and won't be modifiable through the game to avoid potential security breaches in places where it is used! To customize Cleug's behaviour directly, you'll **need to edit the datapack**, which is actually easier than you could imagine!

## Download
Click the 3 dots in the middle upper right corner, choose download repository as archive, and put the archive into the `/saves/datapacks` (`/world/datapacks` for servers) folder and unarchive it. Datapacks load faster as unarchived folders, and that makes it easier to edit if you're planning to!
